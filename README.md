# battleengine
im bored please help me


(why am i editing this now)

 * Battle engine created by pixelized and his lack of dopamine
 * make sure to leave a like, upvote, retweet, comment, subscribe, and rate 5 stars
 *
 * Basically pokemon's battle engine but sucks much worse
 *
 * Present Issues:
 * People inputting random shit will fuck up the scanner
 * more scanner errors
 * Defend doesnt work, maybe add BattlerEffects class with time length attribute to solve this + add expandablity (future effects)
 * make attack choice happen before speed comparison
 *
 * Future possible mechanics:
 * - critical hits
 * - more random chance per hit
 * - elemental damage?
 * - status elements (paralysis, burn, poison, frozen, sleep, (i swear im not copying pokemon)
 * - different attacks
 * - abilities and other attributes
 * - strength stat and weapon power
 * - add a more sophisticated effects system (entire new class)
 * - more sophisticated moves system
 * - accuracy mechanics
